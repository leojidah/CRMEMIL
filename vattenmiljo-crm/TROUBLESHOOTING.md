## 🔴 Current Issue: Environment Configuration

The application is running but needs database configuration to be fully functional.

**Error**: `Invalid URL` when trying to connect to Supabase
**Cause**: Environment variables contain placeholder values instead of real Supabase credentials

## 📝 Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Set Up Supabase Database

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be fully provisioned
3. Go to **Settings > API** in your Supabase dashboard
4. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (starts with `https://`)
   - **anon public** key
   - **service_role** key (⚠️ keep this secret!)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with real values:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Supabase values
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Generate a secure secret for NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

To generate a secure NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations

In your Supabase SQL Editor, run these files in order:

1. **First**: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
2. **Second**: `supabase/migrations/002_kanban_enhancements.sql`

### 4. Test the Setup

```bash
# Test database connection
node scripts/test-db.js

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Test application functionality
node scripts/test-app.js
```

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

Once configured properly, you should see:

### ✅ Database Test Results:
```
✅ Users table accessible
✅ Customers table accessible  
✅ Enhanced customer columns accessible
✅ meetings table accessible
✅ quotations table accessible
✅ water_tests table accessible
✅ installations table accessible
✅ notifications table accessible
🎉 Database connection and migrations test passed!
```

### ✅ Application Test Results:
```
✅ Server is running on port 3000
✅ Authentication middleware working
✅ Signin page accessible
✅ API authentication working
```

## 🚀 Features Ready to Use

Once the database is configured, you'll have access to:

### 🎯 Kanban Board Features:
- **Drag & Drop**: Move customers between status columns
- **Role-based Columns**: Different users see different columns
- **Status Transitions**: Enforced workflow rules
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic UI with error rollback
- **Enhanced Customer Cards**: Rich information display

### 👥 User Roles:
- **Salesperson**: Manages leads through sales process
- **Internal**: Handles all customer stages + sold → installation
- **Installer**: Manages installation process
- **Admin**: Full system access

### 📊 Customer Status Flow:
```
not_handled → no_answer → call_again → meeting_booked 
→ quotation_stage → extended_water_test → sold 
→ ready_for_installation → installation_complete
```

### 🔄 Alternative Paths:
- Any stage → `not_interested` (can be reactivated)
- Final stage → `archived`

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### Issue: "Port in use" warnings  
**Solution**: This is normal - Next.js will find an available port automatically

### Issue: Build warnings about lint
**Solution**: These are from existing code and don't affect functionality

### Issue: Invalid URL errors
**Solution**: Follow the environment configuration steps above

## 📞 Ready for Production

The application is production-ready once configured:

- ✅ Security: NextAuth v5 with proper session management
- ✅ Performance: Optimistic updates and efficient queries  
- ✅ Scalability: Supabase backend with Row Level Security
- ✅ Type Safety: Full TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Modern Stack: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS

## 🎉 Success Criteria
